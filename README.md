This is a fork from ud120-projects for Introduction to Machine Learning course on Data Analyst Nanodegree.  

It has the starter project code for the course.   I have also added codes that I programmed as I did the quizes for the course.  

The original fork was aimed to run on Python 2.7.  Codes were modified to adopt Python 3.6.
